The ACO course and demo video also describe the v1 of the CLI, however development on v1 has now stopped so new services are now only added to v2. v2 is [mostly compatible](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cliv2-migration.html) with v1 and has some nice usability improvements, but the [installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) is a bit more convoluted.\n",

If students have their own accounts, or AWS Educate Starter accounts, encourage them to configure the CLI on their desktop to remote access those accounts. You can suggest to your students to use v2 for this activity and for their local installation."
